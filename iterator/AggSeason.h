/**
 * @brief Generic concrete aggregate for creating season-filtered plant iterators.
 *
 * Creates SeasonIterator instances that filter and return only plants matching
 * the specified target season. Stores the plant collection and provides access
 * to SeasonIterator through friend relationship.
 *
 * **System Role:**
 * Factory for season-specific inventory iteration. Produces SeasonIterator for browsing
 * plants suitable for any season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). Enables seasonal
 * browsing and category-specific customer shopping experiences.
 *
 * **Pattern Role:** Concrete Aggregate (seasonal iterator factory)
 *
 * **Related Patterns:**
 * - Aggregate: Implements iterator factory interface
 * - Iterator: Creates SeasonIterator instances (declared as friend)
 * - Decorator: Works with seasonal decorators for filtering
 * - Facade: Enables seasonal browsing through system
 *
 * **System Interactions:**
 * - Constructor stores reference to plant collection and target season
 * - createIterator() creates SeasonIterator
 * - Returns iterator pre-configured for seasonal filtering
 * - Used by seasonal browsing commands
 * - Replaces season-specific aggregate classes (AggSpring, AggSummer, etc.)
 *
 * @see Aggregate (abstract factory)
 * @see SeasonIterator (concrete iterator created, has friend access)
