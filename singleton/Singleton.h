/**
 * @brief Singleton class managing global inventory and flyweight factories.
 *
 * Ensures only one instance exists and provides global access point through
 * getInstance(). Manages the shared inventory and flyweight factories for
 * efficient memory usage of shared immutable data (seasons, strategies).
 *
 * **System Role:**
 * This class serves as the central resource hub for the entire Photosyntech system.
 * It is responsible for:
 * - Maintaining the single global plant inventory (PlantGroup)
 * - Managing three flyweight factories for memory optimization
 * - Providing consistent access to shared resources throughout the application
 *
 * **Pattern Role:** Singleton (ensures single instance, provides global access point)
 *
 * **Related Patterns:**
 * - Flyweight: Manages three flyweight factories (strategy and season caches)
 * - Composite: Owns the root PlantGroup representing the inventory
 * - Builder: Director obtains strategy instances from singleton
 * - Facade: Accesses inventory and resources through singleton instance
 * - Command: Commands modify inventory state via singleton reference
 * - Observer: Plant group (managed by singleton) broadcasts notifications
 * - Iterator: Iterator factories obtain inventory collection from singleton
 *
 * **System Interactions:**
 * - All subsystems access singleton via getInstance() for shared resources
 * - Flyweight factories accessed for strategy and season object pooling
 * - Inventory (root PlantGroup) serves as hierarchical plant collection
 * - Resource lifetime managed by singleton until application termination
 *
