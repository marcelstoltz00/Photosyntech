# Command Pattern Implementation Challenges

**Date:** October 25, 2024
**Status:** Active Design Decision
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

This document records a critical design decision for the Photosyntech Command Pattern implementation: **adopting a Hybrid Undo Approach** rather than requiring all commands to use the Memento pattern for state capture.

**Decision:** Use Memento for complex state-change operations, and Direct Undo for simple, reversible operations.

---

## The Challenge

The initial specification (`facadeSpec.txt`) prescribes the Memento pattern for all commands:
- PlantMemento for GrowPlantCommand
- BasketMemento for PurchasePlantsCommand
- Implicit expectation for all other commands

This uniform approach has significant tradeoffs that needed evaluation.

---

## Analysis: Memento vs. Direct Undo

### Memento Approach

**Implementation:** Capture complete state snapshot before operation, restore from snapshot on undo.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Uniform pattern across all commands
- ✅ Simplifies complex operations (GrowPlantCommand, PurchasePlantsCommand)
- ✅ State consistency guaranteed—all fields captured automatically
- ✅ Handles state transitions transparently
- ✅ Easier testing—all commands follow identical pattern
- ✅ Less error-prone—no custom reverse logic per command

**Cons:**
- ❌ Memory overhead (snapshots stored in history stack)
- ❌ Copying cost on every execute (field-by-field snapshot)
- ❌ Wasteful for trivial operations (AddPlantToBasketCommand snapshots entire basket)
- ❌ Wasteful for read-only operations (GetSuggestionCommand has nothing to undo)
- ❌ Stale pointer risk (if plant deleted, memento references invalid object)
- ❌ Inflexible (can't implement smart/selective undo)

### Direct Undo Approach

**Implementation:** Implement reverse logic directly in `undo()` method; no state capture.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Memory efficient (no snapshots)
- ✅ Optimal for simple operations (one-liner undo methods)
- ✅ No overhead for read-only operations
- ✅ Smaller command objects in memory
- ✅ Graceful failure modes (explicit error handling)
- ✅ Flexible (can implement selective undo)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complex for state-transition operations (GrowPlantCommand would need to reverse growth rules)
- ❌ Inconsistent patterns across commands
- ❌ More code per command (especially for multi-step operations)
- ❌ Error-prone (easy to forget a field or implement reverse logic incorrectly)
- ❌ Harder to test (each command's undo is unique)
- ❌ Fragile to specification changes (changing growth rules breaks undo logic)

## Command-by-Command Analysis

| Command | Complexity | Memento Overhead | Undo Logic | **Chosen Approach** |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **GrowPlantCommand** | **High** | Minimal | **Would be fragile** | ✅ **Memento** |
| **PurchasePlantsCommand** | **High** | Moderate | **Complex & error-prone** | ✅ **Memento** |
| **AddPlantToBasketCommand** | Low | **Wasteful** | Trivial (1 line) | ✅ **Direct Undo** |
| **CreatePlantCommand** | Low | **Wasteful** | Simple (2-3 lines) | ✅ **Direct Undo** |
| **GetSuggestionCommand** | Minimal | **Total waste** | Read-only (no-op) | ✅ **Direct Undo** |

## Design Decision: Hybrid Approach

### Principle

**Use the right tool for the job:**
- Memento for operations with **complex state management** or **multiple state transitions**
- Direct Undo for operations with **simple, deterministic reversal**

### Implementation Strategy

#### Memento-Based Commands

Use Memento pattern when:
1. Operation involves **state transitions** (e.g., plant growth stages)
2. Operation affects **multiple related fields** (age, health, state all change together)
3. Reverse logic would be **fragile** (tightly coupled to growth rules)
4. **Specification explicitly requires** Memento (GrowPlantCommand, PurchasePlantsCommand)

**Example: GrowPlantCommand**
```cpp
// Execute: Simple—just capture and grow
memento = new PlantMemento(plant);
currentState->grow(plant);

// Undo: Trivial—restore from snapshot
memento->restoreState(plant);
```

#### Direct Undo Commands

Use Direct Undo when:
1. Operation is **purely additive** (add to basket, create object)
2. Reversal is **deterministic and simple** (remove from basket)
3. Memento would capture **unnecessary data** (entire basket for one item)
4. Operation is **read-only** (suggestions, queries)

**Example: AddPlantToBasketCommand**
```cpp
// Execute: Add to basket, store reference
void execute() override {
    basket->addComponent(plant);
}

// Undo: Remove from basket—simple!
void undo() override {
    basket->removeComponent(plant);
}
```

---

## Estimated Impact

### Code Size
- **Pure Memento approach:** ~500 lines total (includes wasteful snapshots)
- **Pure Direct approach:** ~700 lines total (fragile state-transition logic)
- **Hybrid approach:** ~450 lines total ✨ **Optimal**

### Memory Overhead
- **Pure Memento:** ~10KB for 100-command history (minimal but pointless)
- **Hybrid:** ~2KB for 100-command history (snapshots only on 2 commands)

### Bug Risk
- **Pure Memento:** Low (uniform pattern)
- **Pure Direct:** High (state-transition logic is complex)
- **Hybrid:** Low (only simple commands use direct undo; complex ops use Memento)

### Maintainability
- **Pure Memento:** Easy to add new commands (follow same pattern)
- **Pure Direct:** Hard to add new commands (need custom undo per command)
- **Hybrid:** Balanced (clear decision tree: "Is undo simple?" → Direct; else → Memento)

## Design Rationale

### Why Not Pure Memento?

1. **Specification Pragmatism:** facadeSpec.txt only explicitly requires Memento for GrowPlantCommand and PurchasePlantsCommand
2. **Memory Efficiency:** No need to capture entire basket state to undo adding one plant
3. **Cognitive Load:** GetSuggestionCommand memento serving no purpose adds mental overhead
4. **Practicality:** Engineers naturally write direct undo for simple operations

### Why Not Pure Direct Undo?

1. **GrowPlantCommand Fragility:** Reversing plant growth requires understanding state-transition rules:
   - What age increment was applied?
   - Was there a state transition?
   - How were health/water/sun modified?
   - **This logic is brittle and tightly coupled to growth implementation**

2. **PurchasePlantsCommand Complexity:** Reversing a purchase transaction requires:
   - Restoring basket contents
   - Returning plants to inventory
   - Reversing all mediator state changes
   - **Much easier to capture basket state once than reverse all these steps**

3. **Testability:** Hard to verify undo logic works correctly without knowing exact state changes

### Why Hybrid?

**It's pragmatic engineering:**
- Use Memento where it **genuinely simplifies** the code (complex state)
- Use Direct Undo where it's **obviously correct** (simple operations)
- Result: Clean, maintainable, efficient codebase

---

## Exception Handling Strategy

### Memento-Based Commands

```cpp
void GrowPlantCommand::undo() {
    if (plant == nullptr)
        throw std::runtime_error("Plant is null");
    if (memento == nullptr)
        throw std::runtime_error("No memento available");

    memento->restoreState(plant);
    delete memento;
    memento = nullptr;
}
```

### Direct Undo Commands

```cpp
void AddPlantToBasketCommand::undo() {
    if (plant == nullptr)
        throw std::runtime_error("Plant is null");
    if (basket == nullptr)
        throw std::runtime_error("Basket is null");

    basket->removeComponent(plant);  // Explicit, clear operation
}
```

---

## Future Considerations

### If Adding New Commands

**Decision Tree:**

1. **Does undo require capturing multiple related state fields?**
   - YES → Use Memento
   - NO → Continue to step 2

2. **Does undo involve state transitions or complex reversal?**
   - YES → Use Memento
   - NO → Continue to step 3

3. **Is undo a single, simple operation?**
   - YES → Use Direct Undo
   - NO → Reconsider design (may need to split command)

### If Growth Rules Change

**Memento Advantage:** GrowPlantCommand undo continues working unchanged.
**Direct Undo Cost:** Would need to update reverse logic.

## Commands Affected by This Decision

### Scope of Decision

This hybrid approach affects the implementation of:
1. GrowPlantCommand (confirmed Memento)
2. PurchasePlantsCommand (confirmed Memento)
3. AddPlantToBasketCommand (now Direct Undo)
4. CreatePlantCommand (now Direct Undo)
5. GetSuggestionCommand (now Direct Undo - read-only)

### Specification Alignment

**facadeSpec.txt Compliance:**
- ✅ Section 2.2.5 (GrowPlantCommand) - Using Memento as specified
- ✅ Section 2.2.2 (PurchasePlantsCommand) - Using Memento as specified
- ⚠️  Section 2.2.1 (CreatePlantCommand) - Spec mentions "Store plant reference for undo" (vague about Memento)
- ⚠️  Section 2.2.3 (GetSuggestionCommand) - Spec says "No-op (read-only operation)" (Direct Undo)
- ⚠️  Section 2.2.4 (AddPlantToBasketCommand) - Spec mentions state but doesn't require Memento

**Interpretation:** Specification allows flexibility for non-complex commands; hybrid approach is compliant.

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Inconsistent Patterns

**Description:** Some commands use Memento, others use direct undo.
**Impact:** Code navigation slightly more complex.
**Mitigation:**
- Clear decision documented here
- Consistent exception handling across all approaches
- Pattern clear from command name (if simples, likely direct undo)

### Risk: Stale Pointers in Memento

**Description:** If plant deleted after GrowPlantCommand created but before undo.
**Impact:** Undo fails or crashes.
**Mitigation:**
- Mementos only store primitive values (not pointers to plants)
- Restore logic validates plant still exists
- Exception thrown if restoration fails

### Risk: Missed Undo Fields in Direct Undo

**Description:** Developer forgets to undo a state field in direct undo.
**Impact:** Command state is inconsistent after undo.
**Mitigation:**
- Code review checklist
- Unit tests verify all fields reverted
- Keep direct undo commands simple (1-3 fields max)

## Appendix: Code Structure Examples

### Memento-Based Pattern

```cpp
class GrowPlantCommand : public Command {
private:
    LivingPlant* plant;
    PlantMemento* memento;  // Snapshot storage

public:
    void execute() override {
        memento = new PlantMemento(plant);
        currentState->grow(plant);
    }

    void undo() override {
        memento->restoreState(plant);
        delete memento;
    }
};
```

### Direct Undo Pattern

```cpp
class AddPlantToBasketCommand : public Command {
private:
    PlantGroup* basket;
    PlantComponent* plant;

public:
    void execute() override {
        basket->addComponent(plant);
    }

    void undo() override {
        basket->removeComponent(plant);
    }
};
```
