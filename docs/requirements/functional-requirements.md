**Priority**: Medium

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Plants can be grouped by categories
- Individual plants and groups are handled uniformly
- Operations can traverse the entire structure
- Total plant count can be calculated across all levels

---

### FR-8: Inventory Tracking and Notifications
**Description**: The system shall notify staff and customers of inventory changes including sales, new stock arrivals, and stock level changes.

**Subsystem**: Inventory

**Priority**: High

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Notifications sent on inventory changes
- Multiple staff can monitor the same inventory
- Customers receive stock availability updates
- All stakeholders maintain awareness of stock levels

---

### FR-9: Seasonal Plant Filtering
**Description**: The system shall provide the ability to traverse and filter plants based on their assigned growing season.

**Subsystem**: Inventory

**Priority**: Medium

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Plants can be filtered by season
- Traversal through plant collections is possible
- Seasonal information is maintained for each plant
- Users can view season-specific inventory

---

### FR-10: Shared Data Memory Optimization
**Description**: The system shall minimize memory usage by sharing immutable data objects (seasons, watering strategies, sunlight strategies) across multiple plant instances.

**Subsystem**: Inventory

**Priority**: Medium

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Immutable data objects are shared rather than duplicated
- Memory footprint is reduced for large inventories
- Shared objects include season names and care strategies
- System maintains performance while reducing memory consumption

---

## 3. Plant Customization

### FR-11: Plant Decoration
**Description**: The system shall allow plants to be customized with additions such as decorative pots, charms, or other embellishments.

**Subsystem**: Sales Floor

**Priority**: Medium

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Multiple customizations can be applied to a single plant
- Customizations can be added incrementally
- Customized plants maintain core plant functionality
- Original plant properties remain accessible

---

## 4. Staff Management

### FR-12: Plant Monitoring by Staff
**Description**: The system shall allow staff members to monitor assigned plants and receive notifications about health changes and lifecycle transitions.

**Subsystem**: Staff Management

**Priority**: High

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Staff can be assigned to specific plants
- Notifications sent on plant state changes
- Health status changes trigger alerts
- Lifecycle transitions are communicated to staff

---

### FR-13: Staff Action Execution
**Description**: The system shall allow staff to execute actions such as watering plants, managing inventory, and performing care routines. Complex multi-step actions shall be encapsulated to support undo/redo functionality.

**Subsystem**: Staff Management

**Priority**: High

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Staff can perform watering actions
- Care routines can be executed
- Actions are logged and trackable
